¹ This case is probably referable to the period of settlement in Languedoc after
the treaty of Paris in 1229. Prior to that time practical toleration had existed
ν of necessity among the populations resisting the Albigensian crnsades, and the
canons prohibiting intercourse with heretice had been perforce disregardcd. For
this offence reconciliation to the Church with accompanying penance was re·
quired.

²This brief is evidently addressed to arere Robert le Bugre. The story told
by the penitent would seem to be false as respecta his confessing sacramentally to
inquisitore and receiving penance from them. Confession to inquisitore was al·⁴
ways judicael, sor the scal of sacramenta] penance would disable them from
action.

Confession of heresy to a priest‚ with acceptance os penance and absolutior,
did not release the heretic from punishment by the Inquisition; he might be
pardoned by God, as Zanghino tells us (Tract. de Haeret. cap. xxxnr.) but not by
man. In the early days of the Spanish Inquisition culprits endeavored to escape
in this manner and even obtained letters from the papal Penitentiary, bnt thc
inquisitore procured from innocent VIII„ after some tergiversatione, a bull dc·
⁴ claring all such absolutione void. It is noteworthy that he does not forbid the·
Penitentiary to issue them but rather expects it to continue doing so. This was
one of the devices os the curia at the time by which it shared in the plunder of
the rich conversos of Spain by selling to them exemptione in Rome and then
abandoning them to the inquisition in Spain. The bull Ι believe is inedited and
, is worth reprodncing. It shows incidentally the elaborate formulas of exemption
which the Penitentiary had finally adopted.
