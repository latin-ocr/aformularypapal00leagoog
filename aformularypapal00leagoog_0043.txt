. knight applied to his bishop for penance but was referred to Rome, for
the prolate did not venture to assign a penalty to auch a crime, though
he promised 10 confirm whatever the pope might impone. With lettera
and witnesses the knight went to Rome, aad on Easter Monday in the
ohuroh where John XIX. was officiating he stood up and cried for
0000000. When the pope heard the story he turned to a bishop stand·
ing athis right hand and ordered him to reflect and see vvhat was fit
ting for the case.¹ Evidently there was no ghostly tribunal to which
penitents could apply or 10 which they could be referred by the pope

Yet at the same time wehave evidence that before the eleventh century
was out the popes sometimes gave papal authority to shrive ainners, for
Berthold of 00001000010110001101101084110100010,00101001 01 Ostia,
promoted him to priest’s orders and at the same time gave him papal
authorityto admit sinuers to penance‚but this was merely a substitute for
the requisita episcopal linense.² In the thirteenth century we find popes
conferring the title 01 penitentiarum, apparently as amark 01 distinction,
on those in no way connected with the Penitentiary. In 1220 Honorius
III. thus addresses Conrad 01 Marburg, whose sphere of activity was
wholly conlined tu Germany‚ and also Master Jacob, who was his legate
in Ireland.³ St. Ramon 00 Peflafort, who was already a penitentiary
in 1234, and who doubtless took part in drawing up some of the deci-
sions 01 our Formulary, continued to be addressed as penitentiary at
least until 1253, although he left Italy about 1240101110 native Cata·
10010000 seems never to have returned to Rome* No deductions from
the use of such titles can therefore be drawn as to the existence of an
organized Penitentiary as part 01 the curia; nor, 11 the conjecture be
correct that rubrio cn111. of the Formulary is addressed to St. Ramon

The capellanus of the time was equivalent 10 the modern auditor 01 the Rota.

11 is fair to assume that Ramon abandoned Rome in 1240 (Nic. Triveti Chron.

·pan.Vetus II. 67 sqq), when he resigned the Generalate 01 the Dominican Order.
ln 1242 we find him guiding the proceedings 01 the council 01 Tarragona.
