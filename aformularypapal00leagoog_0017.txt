cisalpine ohurohes when priests who had been regularly tried and
senteneed at home hastened to Rome, whither it was impossible to
'follow them with witnesses and testimony, and on their own unsup·
ported statements obtained letters setting aside the y'udgments.l In

Germany in 895 the great national counoil of Tribur denounoed this
supreme jurisdiction of Rome as aburden source to be endured, and
it endeavored to diminish the evil by recommending bishops, when
‹their priests gave them trouble with such letters, to imprison them
until the genuineness of the documents should be proved.² In 1022
the counoil of Soligenstadt shows that Rome was exercising its spir·
itual jurisdiction over the laity with the same results; oomplaint is
made that sinners guilty of eapital offences refusa to submit to the
penanoe imposed on them by their confessore, preferring to go to Rome
in the full confidence that all sins are pardoned there3 this is for-
bidden for the future, the penanee enjoined is first to be performed,
after which the journey to Rome may be undertaken with letters and
lieense from the bishop.³ That this evil did not deorease with time is
seen by the preservation of this canon by St. Ivo of Chartres nearly
a century later.⁴

We are not without individual examples at this period of the
exercise of this papal power and of the resistanoe whioh it exeited.
The holy St. Fulbert Bishop of Chartres writes to Pope John XIX.
(1024-1033) about the misdeeds of Oount Raonl who had assailed the
ohuroh of Chartres, slain one of its ecclesiastiea with his own hand
⁵ and foroed others to take oaths to him: summoned to answer in both
the episcopal and royal courts he had failed to appear and had been
exeommunicated, when he quietly departed to Rome to obtain absolu-
tion. Fulbert begs the pope to inflict due punishment on the offender-
and with soant courtesy adj ures him not to oommit the offense of re·
oeiving him to communion.⁵ Itis quite possible that this vigorous
remonstranoe may have been effective, for the supreme j urisdiotion of
the Holy See was not as yet so firmly established as to be beyond
appeal. About the same time Stephon Bishop of Olermont exeom-
municated Pons Count of Auvergne for abandoning his wife and
taking another, whereupon the offender betook himself to Rome and
obtained absolution from John XIX. Bishop Stephon eomplained of

1Hinomari Epist xxxu. oap. 20. That this remonstrance was reasonable is
seen in the cases recited in papal letters 44 and 53 of waenfeld's Epistl. Pontiff
