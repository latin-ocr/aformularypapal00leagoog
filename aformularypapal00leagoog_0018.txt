this invasion of his episcopal rights and the pope humbly apologized,
withdrawing the absolution which he said had been given in ignoranee
of the excommunication‚ and remittiug the culprit to the meroy of the
bishop.1 This rebuff led to no amendment in the practice of the papal
courtier a few years later we find John XIX. granting a free pardon,
without conditione or penanee, to Hugues Bishop of Auxerre who as
bishop had continued to prosecute a war which he had commenced as
Oount of Chelone before entering the Church.2 Bitter were the com·
plaints at the council of Limoges in 1032 of the confusion caused in
Aquitaine by theunjust absolutione granted by Pope John to those whom
their bishops had righteously excommunicated, and the example was
held up for imitation of the Bishop of Angouleme, who on such a papal
letter being presented to him had refused to receive it on the ground
that it must be fraudulent³ The council moreover decreed that no
one should receive absolution from the pope without consultation with
his bishop, hut it approved of the reference by bishops to the Holy
See of cases of peculiar difficulty* Leo IX. was apope of ahigher
type than J ohn XIX. buthe exercised his authority with equal reck·
lessness when he restored to his functions, on a simple promise of
satisfaction, Gregory Bishop of Vercelli, who had been excommuni-
cated bya Roman synod for perjury and incestuous adultery.⁵

In tbe end remonstrance and resistance were alike in vain. The Holy
See pursued its aims with undeviatiug persistence3 the local churcbes
were unorganized for defence against its encroachmeuts‚ their independ-
ence was undermined and Rome established its supreme jurisdiction as
a matter of undoubted law and fact. This j urisdiction was not simply
appellate, but was also original ; it was a court both of first instance
and of last resort, and it embraced moreover everything that could by
any construction come within the constantly wideniug limits of eccle·
siastioal supervision. It did not disdain to listen to the most trivial
