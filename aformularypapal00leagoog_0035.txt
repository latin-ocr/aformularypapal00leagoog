When the action 01 110 Penitentiary was not injurious it was for the
most part wholly superfluous. The audacious mendacity 01 the storias
told by the suppliants for its favors is sels-evident in many 01 the·
cases recorded in the Formulary; that the penitentiaries recognized
this and their own impotence to ascertain the truth is seen in the
numerous instances in which the case is referred back 10 110 local

cretion. In fact, in rubrio xvn, it is intimated that the Penitentiary
never enjoined the penance, and although this is contradicted by some
cases in which the penance is specified (0.9. rubrio xw. and case 201
rubric oxa), still the general principle at work is that which subsc·

collator conferens illa 10ηο11010 ecclesiastica, pecunia interveniente, non exigit illam
pro collatione beneficii, sed veluti pro emolumento temporali quod tibi conferre
non tenebatur.'’

“Electores ad majoratum vel cathedram posse pretium accipere ut unum prae
alio eligant, eo quod ejusmodi praelatio, cum huic determinatae personae non sit
debita, et aliunde sit ei valde utilis, pretio aestimabilis est.'’

“Qui electores pecunia corrumpit ut eum in Generalem, Provincialem, Priorem
vel Guardianum eligant non subjacet poenis contra simoniacos latis.’'

Itis true that Moya’s book, after a long struggle, was put on the Iudex and
these principles were not puhlicly accepted, but there was practically little differ-
ence between them and the action 01 the Penitentiary 01 the period as seen in
the brief quoted above.
