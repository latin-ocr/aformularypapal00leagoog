under his own excommunication; when the fraud becomes known bis
archdeccon interdicte him and he applies to the Penitentiary which
orders the interdict removed on the ground that no one can excommu-
nicate or absolve himself. The group of cases under rubrics nxxxme
nxxxvr. shows how readily pardon could be obtained for public and
persistent concubinage and explains why the enforcement of the rule
of chastity on the priesthood was so complete a failure in spite of the
spasmodio efforts of reforming councils and prelatos.1 The euricus
code of artificial morality thus created is illustrated in case 2 of rubric
1211„ where a monh who has committed incest with a nun finds the
gravamen of his offence notin the pollution of a bride of Christ,
but in the fact that he had infringed the inviolability of ecclesiastical
persons by once beating his paramour.² Similarly in case 1 of rubric
cxxvi, if a woman with whom a deaoon is living is merely his coneu-
bine, he is to be absolved3 if he has married her he is to be prosecuted
with the full rigor of episcopal jurisdiction.³ The cases under rubrio

¹This papal condonation of immorality continued till the end of the Middle
Ages. About 1450 Nicholas V. prohibited the members and officials of the curia
from keeping concubines under pain of forfaiture of office and incapacity for pre-
ferment “nisi inhabilitatem suam antea per dictae sedis litteras obtinuerint absolvi.’'
-Septimi Decretal. Lib. 111. Tit. i. cap. 3. Among the formulas given by Leone
(Prasia, p. 324) is one by which a priest who has committed an abortion on a
woman whom he seduoed is allowed to retain his parish and continue his func-
tions.

There is a quaint admission of the impossibility of priestly continence in a
fifteenth century formulary of practice before the curia. ln a case where a priest
brings an action against a person who had stigmatized him as a public fornicator
and concubinarian the plaintiff is made to describe himself ss “sobrius et castus
et ab omni actu fornicario abstinens quantum taracus fragilitas sinit.''-Formu·
larium Advocatorum et Procuratorum Romane Curie‚ Basilee‚ 1493, fol. lxxi.

² In a modern case, where a priest seduces a nun in the parlor of her convent
and continues to celebrate mass in spite of the excommunication incurred, he is
restored to his functione except the hearing of eonfessions, is prohibited from Ἴ
entering any nunnery and is declared incapable of obtaining benefices.-Leonis
Prasia, p. 336. Disabilities of this kind however seem tc be only temporary.
Thus another formula recites that some nuns introduced aman into their convent3
for this they obtained absolution coupled with incapacity to fill offices of dig·
nity in the house. After enduring this for awhile they apply for a dispensation
removing it, which is granted and they are declared capable of holding any office.
—Ib. p. 383. “

³Notwithstanding this exhibition of determination to enforce clerical oelibcoy
the constant interference of the curia rendered that rule almost as difficult to
execute as the prohibition of concubinarianism. About 1195 the Bishop of Con·
stance applied to Coelestin ΙΙΙ. for aid in ousting a deacon who while in holy
orders had kept a concubine for six years and on her death had married a wife,
