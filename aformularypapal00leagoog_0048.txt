curia represents this as the organization which has existed 1191111119
beginning, and probably the present Formulary is 1119 1919 remaining
evidence 91 the original constitution 91 the body.

The penitentiaries 91 the thirtecnth century were officials 91 no

little weight and influence in the curia. When Bishop Grosseteste ,

sent his proctor Simon 91 Arden to Rome ou business 191 his see we
find him writing 19 two penitentiaries, brother Raymond and brother
Ernulpho,soliciting their good offices and intervention, and then again
to the latter thanlring him 1911111 services.l An even stronger testi·
mony to their importance is given in the Opus Tropaeum—a work
dating from this period—in which, as a remedy for the prolonged
vacancies frequently occurring in the Holy See through factiuns in
the Sacred College, itis suggested that when the cardinale cannot
within a specified time elect a new pope the conclave shall be
augmented from among the penitentiaries through selection hythe
notaries, or from among the notaries through 1919911911 by the peni-
tentiaries.² This would moreover argue 11191 their number must have
been considerable. They were ec officio 9911911911 91 the cardinale, 91
the members of the papal court and of all bishops‚ archhishops and
patriarcha who happened to bc in Rome³

It only remains to say a few words about the MS. here printed. It
comes to me from Mr. Albert donn, hookseller in Berlin, who can 1911
me nothing 91 119 proveaouce save that it formed partos a purchase
made in Italy in 1889. Ι1 occurs 91 the end of a volume entitled
“ Forme curie romane super beneficiis et questionibus,'' and consists 91
fisty unnumbered pages on fine vellum. The general character 91 111
calligraphy will he seen in the frontispiece which is a facsimile 91 the
page containing 1119 1911 column 91 the table and the first of the text.
Two scribes have been employed on 1119 work, the latter and greater

19 send him 199119 91 these minor penitentiaries with afaculty authorizing his
absolution. He then returns to the Penitentiary with a certificate 91 this and
obtains 9191191 addressed 19 his Ordinary who prescribes the penanoe and satis-
faction 191 his offence. Iu 1119 1911911 91 our Formulary, 91 already stated, we 911911
199 the penitent returned 19 his prolate absolved by 1119 Penitentiary itself.
