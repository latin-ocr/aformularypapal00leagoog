tending and consolidating the power of Rome, hut its capacity in
thie respect was vaetly increased by the wide range of extrancous
cases which it succeeded in bringing within ite jurisdiction. Althougb
the following formulas are entitled “ de casibus penitentie,'’ it will be
seen that out of these many hundreds but few are in truth cases of
conscience. The distinction between the sorum internum and forum
menum had not been clearly defined at the period and the confusion
thence arising was exceedingly favorable to the' growing pratensione of
the Charch. In the development of sacerdotaliem there arose a large
number of “ irregularities'' and “ impedimenta '² ιο be removed only by
the dispensing power. This constituted an intricate branch of law

was an acknowledged episcopal power of dispensation, the Formulary
shows how rapidly it was becoming customary ιο refer all such cases
to Rome.1 The liet of papal reserved cases was still eomewhat obscure
and uncertain, the period was one of transition‚ the old system of the
” penitentiale had broken down and was fast becoming obsoleta. The
bishop‚ immersed in the temporal interests of his see, and the unworldly
abbot who had grown up in the seclusion of conventual life, might well
seek ιο shift their responsibilitiee as to the doubtful interpretatione of a
changing jurisprudenee and might prefer to anticipata the eetting aside
of their decisione by referring matters at once to the ultimate tribunal,
feeling tolerably certain that, if they did not do so, any one diseatisfied
with their conclusione would forthwith appeal to Rome. This gave to
the papacy a direct hold upon every ecclesiastic, and it would scarce be
eaey to overestimate its effectiveneee in aiding the struggle of Rome
for universal deminution. In the following pagee we see the Holy See
as practically the sole source of favore, the only power which at will
could enforce or suspend the rules of discipline. Thie not only secured
to it large revenues and bound to it in subjection every member of the

was inherent in the episcopal office ond this was still good law at the date of our
Formulary (c. 1 Extra Lib. v. Tit. ii. See also c. 32, 33 Extra Lib. v. Tit. xxxix.).
Yet the very numerous cases of homicidal clerks in the following pagos would
seem to indicate that the business was virtually monopolized by the Penitentiary.

In the eighteenth century, lettere of dispensation from the Penitentiary con-
tained the clauses “praesentibus laniatis sub poena excommunicationis ’² and “in
foro judiciario nullatenus suffragentur.’' These were intended to preclude their
use in the forum externum-“ad intercludendam viam quae antiquitus vigebat,

ut per exhibitionem hujusmodi literarum satis probaretur dispensatio.”-Caeus
