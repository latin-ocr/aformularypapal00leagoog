PREFACEs

So far as I am aware no record such as the following has
hitherto been printed, and Ι have thought that students of
medieval life and institutions might perhaps find in it the same
interest that it has excited in me. While its chief importance
lies in indicating the mode in which the..newly established papal
autocracy was used for its own consolidation and perpetuation,
and the manner in which the discipline of the Ohurch was
moulded during its formative period, the wery varied series of
incidents related in the three hundred and fifty-eight cases here

reported afi'ord us vivid glimpses into the -inner life of ecclesi-

astics and laymen in the thirteenth century and into the curicus
standard of morals erected by the Church. We see here at work
some of the forces which moulded the social organimtion of pre·
Reformation Europe and obtain some materials for estimating the
degree in which the Church advanced or retarded the progress of
civilization. To a few of the more salient among these pointsI
have called attention in the Introduction and notes, but there are
scarce any of the cases here detailed which will not furnish food
for reflection to the thoughtful student. I have met with few
medieval documents which have seemed to me so instructive in

so many ways
