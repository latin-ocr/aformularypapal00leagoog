In this transition period, when the “ novum jus '’ was thus deter-
mining the character of ecclesiastica] law for the future, a collection
like our Formnlary has a special importanoe as manifesting the use
made by the Holy See of its newly defined prerogatives. The inter·
pretation of the law is as important as the law itself, and we here aee
how the law was administered in practice by the very men who had so
controlling a part in its framing3 we can guess what portione were
meant to be strictly enforced and what were subject to relaxation; we
see how the sternent rules could be explained away and we may infer
how the gains of the curia could be swelled by enacting laws and then
issuing exemptions from their penalties. We see moreover how the
local prelates, bewildered by the intricaoies of the new system of juris
prudencie, were surrendering virtually their jurisdiction and were re·
forring to Rome not only complicated and important cases but the
most trivial and every-day matters, and we canthus understand how
the Penitentiary, instead of being a simple tribunal of conscience,
becamena court within whose sphere ol action matters of conscience
occupied the smallest place.

The functious thus attributed to it at the start continued to be its
main preoccupation‚ and it speedily became a potent instrumentality
in riveting the control of the Holy See over the subordinate churches.
With the spread of enlightenment that preceded the Reformation the
incongruitybetween its ostensibleand its real functions provoked adverse
comment, and some jurists ventured to argue that the letters of the Peni-
tentiary were valid only in the sorum corwoicntioe and notin the sorum
contentiosum, but Sixtns IV. in 1484 indignantly stamped this preten-
sion as sacrilegious and ordered that they should be received as full
authority in all courts, secular as well as ecclesiastical.¹ When the
Reformation cameto unsettle the traditions of the past, criticism grew
bolder, and the bull of Sixtus IV. had to be reissued by Paul 111. in
1549 and by Julius 111.in1550.² Men, however, were growing less
amenable to papal authority, und when in 1562 the final assembly of

interpolating the older decretals to adopt them to the existing views of the
Holy See. See Schulte, Das Katholisohe Kirchenrecht‚ I. 338-9.

is worth noting that in rubrio cxxrr. of the Formulary the Penitentiaryimpliedly
limits its functions to the foram poenitentiae and disclaims jurisdiction within the
forum contentiosam. Yet the “confession'’ so often alluded to in the letters is
evidently not sacramental. By this time the seal of the confessional was sus-
ficiently established for the Penitentiary not to commit the indiscretion of re-
vealing its secrets in the manner customary in the Formnlary. The penitentiaries

therefore were not confessors like the modern minor penitentiaries.
