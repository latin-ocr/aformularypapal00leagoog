gestire of differeuce in the liberality of the several penitents. Equally
suggestive is the almost uniformly lavorable character of the decisione
which, except iu cases involving heresy or opposition to papal author·
ity, lean to the side of mercy, reckless of the damage to morale and
discipline. In many cases indeed bribery is the readiest explanation
· of the uncalled·for lenity shown. There were few graver offences iu
the eyes of the curia than the forgery or falsification of papal letters
and yet in the rubrics xnvm. and xnrx. we have instances of deacons
guilty of this who are allowed to continue in the exercise of their
functione, although the canon law, iu the contemporary Decretals of
Gregory ΙΧ., provided that clerks committing this crime should be
perpetually deprived of office and benefice, be degraded and handed
over to the secular arm for condign punish ment.1 So iu rubric cnxn.
there is a case of au apostate subdeacon who for twenty years or more
had served as a soldier, and who is readmitted to his functions with
eligibility for promotion ou his simple declaration that he had not
been concerned in any death or mutilation. Case 3 of rubric nxxvn.
presente us with apricat who had hnowingly received goods stolen from
his own church and had continued celebrating mass in spite of the
excommunication of all concerned in the sacrilegious robbery: his
bishop apparently had declined to absolve him, but had given him
letters to the Penitentiary, whichxnot only granted absolution but
dispensation for the “ irregularity '’ incurred in exercising his func·
tions while thus under excommunication. Sometimes indeed the
Penitentiary seems to have had the grace to feel ashamed of the part
which it was playing, and its letters, like that in rubrio cxxmx, are
models of a skilful avoidance of responsibility, while recommending
mercy under a cloud of vagus and ambiguous phrases—the case in
question being the atrocious one of a mock marriage celebrated by a
priest to deceive a woman.

The effect of all this on the discipline of the Church could not fail
to be deplorable‚ aud it may be regarded as one of the leading causes

¹ Cap? Extra Lib. v. Tit. xx. The evil customs introduced by the venality of
the Middle Ages left an indelible impression on the Chureh. Somewhat similar
to the above cases is one provided for in a formula of the modern Penitentiary.
A friar obtains fraudulent papal letters permitting him to leave his order: he
ministers as a secular priest till he is over seventy years of age and then, assuming
that he is too old to endure the rigore of conventual life, he applies to the Peni-
tentiary for absolution and adispensation to continue his priestlyfunctions, which
are duly granted—Marc. Paul. Leonis Praxis ad Litteras Maioris Poenitentiarii,
Mediolani, 1665, p. 333. There is another formula of absolution for fulsifying a
papal absolutiou (p. 374).
