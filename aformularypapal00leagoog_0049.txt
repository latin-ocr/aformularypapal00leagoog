A few notes have been introduced where they seemed desirable to
elucidate the text, or to identify persons or places or dates. Where
more than one case occurs under a rubrio 1 have numbered them tc
facilitate reference. Occasionally where there is' an evident omission
of a word or a mistakc of the copyist I have ventured to insert an
emendation in brackets [-].

¹ Ciacconii Vit. Pontif. et Card. ΙΙ. 322,

Since the text of the Formulary was in type Ι have met with a decree of
Innocent III. in 1204 which elucidatas the cases in rubrica xc.,01v., cV111.,and
clx.

“Ex parte tua fuit propositum coram nobis quod quidem presbiteri Greci
pariter et Latini a Grecis episcopis absque unctione manuum se faciunt ordmeri,
et simul accipiunt omnes ordines extra quatuor tempora contra canonicas sanc·
tiones. Cum igitur huiusmodi presumptio sit sagaciter extirpanda fraternitati
tuae per ap. scripta mandamus, quatinus huiusmodi presbiteros tuse diocesis ab
executione ordinis sic suscepti appellatione remota nostra fretus auctoritate sus·
pendas nisi forsan eorum aliqui de tua uel predecessoris tui licentia fuerint ab
episcopis Grecis taliter ordinati, circa quod suppleas quod ab illis fuerit preter-
missum, et provideas tamen attente ne clericos tuae diocesis ab episcopis Grecis
ulterius ordinari permittas, et si qui preter tuam uoluntatem ab eis se fecerint
ordinari, tu eos suspendas perpetuo ab executione ordinum taliter susceptorum.”
—Oompilat III. Lib. 1. Tit. ix. c. l (FrIedberg, p. 108).

Why this should have been omitted from the Decretals of Gregory IX. is not
apparent. It evidently was an inveterate abusa that those unable to obtain
ordination at home should resort to the Greek prelates of southern Italy, nor
was it easy to suppress so long as the Penitentiary was ready tc issue dispensations
tc those who had profited by it. The ease is not fully met by the decrees of
Coelestin III. and Innocent III. preserved by Gregory (c. 9, 11, Extra 1. xi).
