XXX INTRODUOTION.

finally in 1744 Benedict XIV. reorganized it on the lines laid down
by St. Pius V., but he still considered it necessary 10 prescribe that all
briefs should be issucd gratuitously and he preserved the formula 01
the oath to be taken by all the officials, containing a clause that no
gista, even spontaneously offered, should be raccepted.l

The Formulary throws some light 001110 original constitution 011110
Penitentiary, which, as we shall 000, differed in some respecta from that
which it assumed subsequently. 110 originis 10 be looked 101 10 the
custom which sprung up, probably in the third century, 01 bishops
appointing 10 their churches some competent priest whose function
was to listen to repentant 0100010 and guide them back to virtue.²

’ This however was by no means universal or coutinuous, and about

at each 01 three churches, St. Peter’s, 81. Paul’s and St. Laurence’s, in
which priests should romain to receive penitents and administer bap·

tom appears to have 101100 1010 1110000 and was virtually superseded by
the penitentiale, 01 which every priest was required to have a copy.4
These were completely independent 01 Rome, 10110001 autonomy had
not yet been broken down, and no one imagined that any exclusive
jurisdiction over the subject was inherent 10 the Holy See. When,
about 825, Ebbo 01 Reims complained 01 the 0001101011Ιο confusion
arising from the diversity 01 the manuals circulating among the

(Bullar. Benedict. XIV. T. Ι. p. 149).

The cath prescribed for the officials is-“ Ego N. Regens 011 hac hora in antea
010 fidelis et obediens Β. Petro et domino nostro Papae N. eiusque successorihus
canonice eutrantibus: officium meum fideliter exercebo et gratis, eiusque ratione

The functione of the Penitentiary 010 now strictly confined to 1110 sorum
internum, except in the 0000 01 1001011010 01 religious orders. They extend over
all reserved cases, even those 01 the Bull 111 coenc Domini and its successor Apos-

Notwithstanding the immense extension 01 the Catholic Church throughout
the world the business of the Peuitentiary now requires only three scriveners
and three procurators.-Bangen, Die Romische Curie, p. 424.
