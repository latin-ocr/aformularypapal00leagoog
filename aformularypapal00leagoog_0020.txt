As for pardons and dispensatione, when Paul ΙΙΙ., in 1538, appointed
a commission of the leading cardinale of the Sacred Collega-Sadoleto,
Caraffa (afterwards Paul lv), Contarini and Reginald Pole—to draw
up a scheme of reformation for the curia, they referred in the most
forcible terma to the indescribable scandale and evils arising from the
sale of perdone hythe Penitentiary, as pervading the whole of Christen-
dom and preventing all wholesome enforcement of discipline every·
where; such monstrous abusos, they essert, are sufficient to destroy any
human society tolerating them, and they adjura him earnestly‚ by the
blood of Christ, to put an end to them.¹

That the Penitentiary had been venal from the beginning can well
be believed. The concurrent testimony of Europe throughout the
Middle Ages as to the rapacity of the curia is too emphatic to be
called in question. In the middle of the twelfth century St. Bernard
addressing Eugenius III. assumes that the whole discipline of the
Church is directed to the extortion of money, which Italy grasps with
insatiable greed.'² As a means of accomplishing this object the Peni-
tentiary was especially adopted, for it had the granting of absolutione
and dispensatione practioally without supervision. How eagerly every

after reciting other evils arising from appeals authorizes the bishops to refuse
them in cases under 40 sols. in velue—Comp. II. Lib. 11. Tit xix. c. 12 (lbid. p.
78). Soou afterwards, to chech mere dilatory appeals, which were exceedingly
common, Coelestin III. empowered bishops to excommunicate those who did not
within twenty days set out for Rome (Ibid. c. 19). After this the policy of the
curia changed. It was probably reorganized on a footing which enabled it to
dispose of the business aud reap the harvest thence arising. Noue of these
restrictive decrees are retained iu the Decretals of Gregory IX, and in their
place we have the earlier ones of Alexander III. granting one, two, and even more
years in which to prosecute an appeal, and ordering them to be entertained in
the most trivial cases (c. 5, 8, 11, Extra Lib. 11. Tit. xxviii).

1Alius abusus magnus et minime tolerandus, quo universus populus Christianus
scandalizatur est ex impedimentis quae inferuntur episcopis in gubernatione sua·
rum ovium, maxime in puniendis scelestis et corrigendis. Nam primo multis viis
eximunt se mali homines, praesertim clerici, a jurisdictione sni ordinarii: deiude,
si non sunt exempti, confugiunt statim ad Poenitentiariam vel ad Datariam, ubi
confestim inveniunt viam impunitati et quod pejus est ob pecuniam praestitam:
hoc scandalum, beatissime pater, tantopere conturbat Christianum populum ut
non queat verbis explicari. Tollantur, obtestamur sanctitatem tuam per sangui-
nem Christi quo redemit sibi ecclesiam eamque lavit eodem sanguine, tollantur
hae maculae, quibus si daretur quispiam aditus in quacunque hominum republica
aut regno confestim, aut paulo postia praeceps rueret, nulloque pacto diutius
constare posset; et tamen putamus nobis licere ut per nos iu Christianam rem·
publicam inducantur haec monstra-Le Plat, Monument. Concil. Trident. II. 601.
