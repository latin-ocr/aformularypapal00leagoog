of entrance paymeuts grew to be a matter of course. The council of
Trent endeavored to suppress it indirectly by providing that no con·
vent should receive more iumates than could be supported by its regu·
lar revcnues or the customary receipt of 511115.ι Iu tardy obedience to
this, thirty years later, the council oi Aquileia suggests that the num·
ber of inmates in nunneries be allowed to diminish by death till it shall
he reduced to what cau be supported and that meanwhile funda be Ι
pmcured by placing boxes in the churches to receive the contributione
of the charitable.² Meanwhile in 1572 Gregory XIII. had opened the
way to an official recognition of this form of simony, in the case of 'Ier-
tiary nuns, by directing the bishops to urge that the kindred of those
desiring admission should contributa to the house a sum of money
approaching the dower that would be required in case of marriage.³
This showed how the Tridentino canon and simony were to be recon-
cited, and accordingly in 1583 we find the council of Reims ordering
that no more monks or nuns shall he admitted than the revenues of
the house can support, but it warmly approves liberal “ alms'' spon·
taneously brought 1))’1115551111551115114 These transparent subterfuges
were wholly disregarded in practical life, for in Catholic countries
where girls had virtually only the alternative of marriage or conventual
life the pressure on the nunneries rendered payment for admission ob·
ligatory. Santa Teresa had no scruple in bargaiuing with applicants
as to what they should pay for admission into her reformed order of
Barefooted Carmelites⁶ and such paymeuts are still one of the recog·
nized meanings of the innocent word “ dower.”⁶ 111 fact, the inability
to make such payment is admitted by 1115 Penitentiary itself as a suf·
’ ficient reason for commuting a vow to 5111515 religious order.7
