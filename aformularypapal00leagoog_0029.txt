collection is evidently a carefnl selection by a cardinal of formulas to
serve as guides and precedents for practical use, and they are there·
screto be considered as authoritative sentences on the principal subjecta
which habitually came before the Penitentiary for action and decision.
That by far the greater portion of them are concerned with cases of
ecclesiastics can scaroe, Ι think, be taken as an evidence that clerical
cases formed so preponderating aportion of the business of the Peni· .
tentiary, but rather that these were regarded by the collector as the
most interesting and useful to him, inasmnch as they involved so many
questions relating to irregularities, impedimenta and dispensatione.

It may be not without interest to note the influence of the system in
one or two matters in which changes in the practice of the Church
may be traced with more or less clearness to the influence of the dis·
pensing and pardoning power. The cases under rubrio x11., respecting
payments made to secure entrance into monasteries show how delicate
were the scruples of conscience afflicting the souls of'those guilty of
such offences and the manner in which the Penitentiary smoothed their
path back to grace. These scruples vvere simply in accordance with
ecclesiastica] doctrine. In 1163 Alexander ΙΙΙ. at the council of Tours
forbade as simony the acceptance of any consideration for receiving an
applicant in a monastery,¹ and the same pope enforced the rule in
pnnishing an abbot and the officials of his convent for exacting such
a payment, by suspending them from their fonctions and compelling

constituit hoc ut provideat vitae alicujus temporali, multa millia animarum pro

A very significant instance of latitudinarianism occurs in the conditions imposed
by the Penitentiary in the seventeenth century for releasing a man from a vow to
enter a religious order, “ dummodo vitam coelibem ducat,'' which is explained by
the commentator to mean that while he must not marry it does not debar him
from other carnal indulgence-“si enim voluisset imponere voventi continentiam
ab omni copula carnali et venerea delectatione, usurpasset nomen castitatis nou
autem coelrbntns‚'’ which is not improved by the distinction drawn between human
law and divine law “ quia quoad alias delectationes carnales et libidinosas a lege
divina omnibus hoo est prohibitum’'-Leonis Praxis ad Litt. Maior. Poenitent.
pp. 64, 83. Leone was employed in the Papal Penitentiary for fourteen years
(lbid. p. 216), his work bears the approbation of the Master of the Sacred‘ Palace
. andos the Provost Genernl of the Society of J esus, of which hc was a member,

and it may therefore be regarded as semi-official.
