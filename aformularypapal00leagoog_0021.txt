opportunity of effecting this was seized is aptly illustrated by a faculty
of Innocent IV. in 1243 ιο the Abbot of Nidarholm in Iceland. Few
penitents from so distant a spot could be expected ιο visit Rome and
it was more profitable to establish a local Penitentiary there. The
abbot is therefore authorized to grant absolution in certain cases on
the payment by the offenders of what the journey to Rome and bach
would eost them-the Holy Land as usual being designated as the
recipient of the proceeds.¹ Whether the notorious Taxes of the Peniten·
tiary be authentia or not is a question only of detail and not of prin·
ciple, for the pecuniary redemption of penanoe was a practice established
for centuries-in fact, until the Reformation opened meu’s eyes to the
enormity of such transactions, there was no hesitation in carrying on the
traffic openly. When its propriety began to be questioned,aconsultation
submitted to Pius ΙΙΙ. in 1536 argues that it is peifectly legitimate to
· receive money for the pardon of sins and the granting of dispensatione.²
It is therefore no wonder that men had no hesitation in believing and
asserting that the system was devised wholly for the benetit of the papal
treasury and without regard ιο its deplorable effect on morals. In*
1359 when Innocent VI. made a demand on the German clergy and
Charles IV. gathered his magnates at Mainz to listen ιο the papal legate,
Conrad von Alzey‚ chancellor of Rupert Count Palatine‚ in enumerating
the methods by which Rome impoverished Germany included the money
paid for absolutions‚³ and Charles himself, whose devotion to the Holy
See earned for him the title of “the priests' emperor‚'' reproached the
legate with the unchecked license a'nd vileness of the clergy, for Rome
was solely occupied with seizing the fleeces of the flock and cared
nothing about the salvation of the sheep or the enforcement of dis·
