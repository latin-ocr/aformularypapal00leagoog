oxrx. show us how much more leniently the erime of perjury was re-
garded in Rome than by the loeal bishops. When Rome was thus .

looked upon as a fountain of pardon for all infractione of the deoa-
logue‚ it need not surprise us to see (rubrio cxxrr1v.)an adulteress
who, 00 hecoming a widow, had married her lover, applying to the
Penitentiary for aid and eounsel to protect her from evil-speaking
tongues, and who was sent back to her bishop with a letter instrueting
him to leave her in peaee, while nothing is said about the five years'
penanoe provided for suoh eases.¹ It would be superfluous to adduee
more examples, for there are few among these cases whieh do not
illustrate all this to a greater or less degree. We can readily accept
the assertion 01 Bishop Grosseteste, in 1250, that the euria through
its dispensatione and provisions and granting 01 beneficas to the unfit
was the primary cause 01 the unspeakable moral degradation 01 the
priesthood.² It was not an unnatural development from all this that
in the popular belief the papal power was equal to granting ahsolution
in advanee for sins to he committed, as is seen in Dante’s recital 01 the
interview between Guido da Montefeltro and Bonifaoe VIII. where
the pope absolves him 00 the spot for the sin whieh he urges him to

commit :
- Fin' or t’ assolvn, e 10 m'insegni fare
Si come Penestrino in terra 30111.
Lo Ciel poss’ io serrare e disserrare
Come tu sai: pero son due le obieri—Irrwwauu xxv11.

In considering the records 01 the Formulary it must he borne in
mind that they are not to be regarded as mere isolated cases. The

retaining his benefice all the while in spite 01 011 efforts to deprive him. Το the
bishop’s appeal the answer was to leave the offender in peace—Compilat. II.
Lib. 1. Tit. xi. 0 1 1111011003, 0. 70). Nearly as disheartening was the experi-
enee 01 the Bishop 01 Terouane who, about 1220, reported to Honorius lII. that
in his diooese clerks in holy orders did not hesitate to marry, alleging in defence
the eustom 01 the land. On this the pope ordered him to deprive thern 01 their
henefieea but when he prooeeded to do so they had 00 difficulty in procuring
papal letters 0001100103 them in possession and enabling them to persecute him.
It is true that on the matter being explained to Honorius he had no seruple in
cancelling his letters, buthe treats the transaetion as a matter 01 course-Com·
pilat. V. Lib. 11 Tit xx. 0. 4; Lib. 111. Tit. 11. 0. 2l1bid. 00. 168-9).

² After deseribing 10 the most vigorous terms the appalling vices 01 1110011001-
hood Grosseteste, addressing 10000001 IV. adds “Causa fons et origo hujus est
haee ouria, non solum eo quod haee mala non dissipat et has abominationes 000
purgat, eum ea sola hoe maxime possit et ad hue summe teneatur, sed 00 amplius
quod ipsa quoque per suas dispensationes et provisiones et collationes curae pasto·
