any relaxation in the theory or dogma of the Ohurch. Not only were
the rigorous canons nominally in force, but they were even sharpened
in the fifieenth century by Martin V. and Eugenius IV. Even when
no money or other consideration was given, simple petitions and
prayers 101 a benefice addressed to the patron were held to infect the
bestowal with the taint of simonyl Confessors were instructed to make
the most searohing inquiry of their penitents in holy orders to detect
all offences 01 this kind, direct or indirect, with a minuteness similar
to that which we see exhibited in our Formulary.¹ Yet this was of
little avail for good when dispensations were 10 be had by all who
. understood how to apply for them. The canons were minute and
imperative, but they were robbed 01 their terrors under such a sys-
tem, and their very sharpness only served 10 increase the revenues 01
the curia. In the seventeenth century formulary of the Penitentiary
there is a brief by which a cleric who has purchased two beneficas is
allowed to retain them, to be promoted to priest's orders, and to
minister in them.² In this the Penitentiary only followed at an
humble distance the magnificent acquisitiveness 01 the papacy itself.
Even as early as the close 01 the thirteenth century itis a significant
fact that the first thing a newly confirmed bishop does is to apply
to the Holy See for authority 10 borrow money, evidently to settle
his debts with the curia. Thus the election 01 Arnaud to the
wealthy see of Toulouse was confirmed March 17, 1298, and on
April 17th he was granted two authorizations each one enabling
him to borrow 20‚000 florins. Every fonction 01 the curia war
thus for sale. When on March 13, 1298, a decision was rendered
in favor 01 Aymon‚ abbot 01 St. Antoine 01 Vienna, it was accom-
panied with a special faculty enabling him to postpone all his other
debts unt'il he should have settled the very large ones which he had
incurred in Rome. S0‚May25, 1298, the Abbot of Montmajour is
authorized to extend time on his other debts 101 three years in order
to enable him to meet those contracted in Rome, amounting, we may
presume, to 6000 fiorins, 101 that is the sum which he is permitted to
borrow by a letter cf June 9. Then, October 25, 1298, David is con·
firmed as prior-general 01 the Order 01 0010011011, and on November
27 he is authorized 10 borrow 3000 florins and apportion the liability

among the houses 01 the Order, to discharge the debt contracted with

, ters 01 Leo X, now in course 01 publication by Hergenrother, are full 01 assign-

ments 01 such pensions 10 his favorites.
