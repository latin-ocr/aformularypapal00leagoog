of the laxity prevalent during the Middle Ages. Every culprit con·
demned at home was sure ofa hearing by the Penitentiary on ea parte
statements, and of a sympathizing letter addressed to his prelate which,
coming from such asouroe, was equivalent to a command. The Formu·
lary is crowded with such cases, which must necessarily have produced
a most disheartening effect on those who were endeavoring to repress
the perpetual disorders of the clergy. Thus rubric nxxxrx. concerns a
priest accused of homicide aud put on his purgation, in which he failed,
this being, under the law of the period, equivalent to conviction. His
bishop necessarily deprived him of function and benefice, whereupon
he hastened ιο Rome, complaining that the bishop had not been im-
partial in the selection of the compurgators, and he returns with a
letter ordering his restoration. Case rof rubric xxvm.is a curicus
story in which an ecclesiastic relates that when travelling with a canon
regular he killed his companion with blows with the flat of a swerd
because the latter had insisted on bringing a woman ιο bed with him:
for this his bishop suspended him, but is now ordered not only to re·
store him but ιο account ιο him for the fruits of his benefice during
his suspension. In case 6 of the same rubrio we bave a homicide
mouk forced back upon his abbot who had ejected him. In case 1 of
rubric nxvr1.we find the Penitentiary impartially issuing letters in
favor of both sides ιο a controversy, ιο the no small confusion of the
matter.¹ Case 2 of rubrio oxrx. shows us apriest guilty of perjury,
whom his bishop refused to relieve from suspension on the strength of
letters from oue of the penitentiaries, and who now obtains another
from the whole body, in which the labor and expense of his double
visit to Rome are given as a reason for restoring him. Similarly in
rubric cxxxvr11.a bishop is instructed to moderate the rigor of a
decree of the Lateran Council in view of the labor eutailed on the
offender by coming ιο Rome. Case 2 of rubrio ccxl. concerus amonk
in priestly orders who had quitted his convent and led avagabond life,
subsisting on the administration of the sacramenta, and who is now seut
back with orders for his readmission.² Itis true that usually the pre·

Alexander III. when a priest and a burgher ol Reims had a suit over a house,
