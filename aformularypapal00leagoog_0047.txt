cardinal-it is the “potestatem majoris poenitentiarii nostri per lon·
gissima tempora toti orbi uotam.'' The body of canonias has disap
peared, who originally acted in concert, and who iu 1311 were still
recognized as forming part of the commission. Itis interesting to
observe however that the letters were still issued as in our Formulary,

sometimes simply “auctoritate domini papae’' and sometimes “de
speciali mandato domini papae.''¹ Iu this form the Penitentiary
has continued to the present day, through all the changes made by

Pius IV„ Pius V. and Benedict XIV. It consists of a cardinal known
as the Major Poeniuntiariau with a varying number of officials under

him to perform the duties of his office and who are theoretically merely
his assistente to relieve him from details. Though as a matter of fact
only doubtful or important cases are referred to him, and even some
times to the pope, all the letters expedited bear his seal aud derivo their
authority from the faculties conferred on him.² The tradition of the

gives the formulas to be employed-

“Auctoritate Domini Nostri Papae cujus Paenitentiarii curam gerimus.''

“Auctoritate Domini Papae etde ejus speciali mandato super hoc vivae vocis
oraculo sibi facto.''

“ Dicta auctoritate Domini Papae et ejus speciali et expresso mandato.''

The seal of the Major Penitentiary atthis time is thus described in a contem-
porary document—‘⁴ Litteras . . . sacrosancte Romane ecclesie presbiteri cardi·

= nalis domini nostri pape et sancte sedis apostolice majoris penitentiarii ejus vero
sigillo oblongo in cera rubea alba circundata cum cordula sericea rubri croceique

When the case has been referred to the pope the letter contains the clause
“auctoritate apostolica specialiter et expresse praevia consultatione nobis ex-
pressa''-Leonis Praxis ad Litt. Maior. Poenit. p. 223.

The Major Penitentiary has the appointment of acertain number of Minores
Paenitentiam who sitin the three basilicas of St. Peter's, St. John Lateran and
Santa Maria Maggiore, to hear the confessione of penitents from all lands and
to grant absolutione, imposing on them fitting penance. They have faculties in
regard to certain reserved cases, but they are merely confessors with somewhat
enlarged powers and their functions are altogether different from that of the
Congregation of the Penitentiary, of which they form no part. For details see
the Manuale Facultatum minorum Poencfentiariornm Apostolicorum, Romae, 1879.

It is possible that the functionaries objurgated by John XXII. and imprisoned
by Cardinal Annibaldo may have been of this class.

Leone in his Prasia lp. 287) tells us that when a penitent personally visits
Rome for ahsolution in papal reserved cases the custom is for the Penitentiary
